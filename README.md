# Ozric Addon for Home Assistant

This is an [add on](https://www.home-assistant.io/addons/) for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

## What It Does

By continuously monitoring the states of your various sensors, switches and the environment, Ozric can turn on and off your lights in a very customisable and reactive way.
This logic is customisable and described by a graph, which you can edit visually.

This is very similar to [Node Red](https://nodered.org/), but Ozric is not message-oriented. Instead it is continuously evaluated and responds to internal (computed) state changes as well as sensor changes.

## Compatibility

Ozric is compatible with HA OS or HA Supervised installations, as these are built on [Docker](https://docker.com).

## How To Install It

Go to the Add Ons repository in your Home Assistant [Add-On Dashboard](http://homeassistant:8123/hassio/dashboard) and click on the link at the bottom right to go to the Add On Store. 

From there click "Repositories" in the top right and add the URL [https://github.com/jchown/ozric-addon](https://github.com/jchown/ozric-addon). The add-on will then be available to install in the main Add-On Dashboard.
