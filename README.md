# Ozric Addon for Home Assistant

This is an "add on" for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

## What It Does

By continuously monitoring the states of your various sensors, switches and the environment, Ozric can turn on and off your lights in a very customisable and reactive way.
This logic is customisable and described by a graph, which you (will be able to) edit visually.

For example, you can have a light that is automatically switched on & off by a sensor. This is HA 101. But Ozric also allows you define the exact colour for the "on" state
based on (say) the time of day or other modal changes within your home.

## How To Install It

Go to the Add Ons repository in your Home Assistant [Add-On Dashboard](http://homeassistant:8123/hassio/dashboard) and click on the link at the bottom right to go to the Add On Store.

From there add the URL [https://github.com/jchown/ozric-addon](https://github.com/jchown/ozric-addon). The add-on will then be available to install in the main Add-On Dashboard.
